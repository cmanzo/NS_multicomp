# Nested Sampling approach for the multicomponent fitting of data from segmented super-resolution images (NS_multicomp)
We developed a Bayesian approach based on the Nested Sampling algorithm for the multicomponent fitting of data obtained from the segmentation of super-resolution image. The algorithm provides an estimation of the Bayesian evidence to perform model ranking, calculates the model best-fit parameters and their confidence interval. Please refer to the [article](http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/C9CP05616E) below for further information.
A simulated dataset of 300 datapoints with ground truth values *K*=5 and decreasing weights ùú∂=(0.3333,0.2667,0.2000,0.1333,0.0667) is provided for testing. The calibration function used to generate the data is a lognormal distribution with *¬µ*=3.3491 and ùúé=0.8462.

## Authors
The R and Matlab code was developed by T. Ko≈°uta and C. Manzo in 2019 as part of a research project of [the QuBI lab](https://mon.uvic.cat/qubilab/ "the QuBI lab") carried out at the Faculty of Science and Technology of the Universitat de Vic - Universitat Central de Catalunya (Spain) in collaboration with F. Cella Zanacchi.
